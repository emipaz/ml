    "# Introduction to TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this week's programming assignment! Up until now, you've always used Numpy to build neural networks, but this week you'll explore a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks more easily. Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle, Torch, Caffe, Keras, and many others can speed up your machine learning development significantly. TensorFlow 2.3 has made significant improvements over its predecessor, some of which you'll encounter and implement here!\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to do the following in TensorFlow 2.3:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `tf.Variable` to modify the state of a variable\n",
    "* Explain the difference between a variable and a constant\n",
    "* Train a Neural Network on a TensorFlow dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming frameworks like TensorFlow not only cut down on time spent coding, but can also perform optimizations that speed up the code itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/supplement/QWEnZ/h-ow-to-refresh-your-workspace)."

    "## 2 - Basic Optimization with GradientTape\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of TensorFlow 2 is in its simplicity. Basically, all you need to do is implement forward propagation through a computational graph. TensorFlow will compute the derivatives for you, by moving backwards through the graph recorded with `GradientTape`. All that's left for you to do then is specify the cost function and optimizer you want to use! \n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a TensorFlow program, the main object to get used and transformed is the `tf.Tensor`. These tensors are the TensorFlow equivalent of Numpy arrays, i.e. multidimensional arrays of a given data type that also contain information about the computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you'll use `tf.Variable` to store the state of your variables. Variables can only be created once as its initial value defines the variable shape and type. Additionally, the `dtype` arg in `tf.Variable` can be set to allow data to be converted to that type. But if none is specified, either the datatype will be kept if the initial value is a Tensor, or `convert_to_tensor` will decide. It's generally best for you to specify directly, so nothing breaks!\n"
